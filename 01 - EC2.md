# EC2

## Instance Types

* Determine CPU, RAM, network, and potentially GPU
* Can only change instance type on EBS-backed instances, while stopped
* Main Types
  * R - RAM-optimized 
  * C - compute-optimized
  * M - general purpose (medium)
  * I - I/O-optimized (instance storage)
  * G - provides GPU access
  * T2/T3
    * Burstable - must keep track of CPU credits, which regenerate over time
    * Unlimited - lets you use a 24-hour period's worth of burst credits

## Placement Groups

* Cluster
  * Colocated instances in single AZ
  * Better networking performance
  * Higher risk
  * Unavailable for t2 instance types
* Spread
  * Instances are placed on different hardware
  * Max 7 instances per AZ
  * Useful for high availability
* Partition
  * Groups of instances are colocated within separate partitions
  * Maximum 7 partitions per AZ, 100s of EC2 instances
  * Partition data available via instance metadata

## Shutdown Behavior

* Can be set to stop or terminate on OS shutdown
  * Available via CLI attribute `InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior`
  * Bypasses termination protection

## Troubleshooting

* `InstanceLimitExceeded` error: max instances per region limit reached
  * Either launch in different region or request limit increase
  * Default limit: 20 instance per region
* `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` error: AWS doesn't have enough on-demand capacity within an AZ
  * Solve by waiting a few minutes before requesting again
  * Request in batches if necessary
* Instance terminating immediately
  * EBS volume limit
  * EBS snapshot currupt
  * Unable to decrypt due to KMS permissions
  * Instance store AMI is missing a required part
  * Look at State Transition Reason label
* SSH issues
  * 400 permissions on key (`chmod 400 key.pem`)
  * Use correct username when using SSH
  * Incorrect security group

## Instance Launch Types

* On Demand Instance
  * short workload
  * highest cost, no upfront payment
* Reserved
  * reserved for one or three years
  * useful for long-running workloads (database, web app)
  * can choose convertible reserved instance to change instance type
  * scheduled reserved instances allow you to schedule instances
  * up to 75% discount from on-demand type
* Spot Instances
  * cheap, less reliable
  * don't use for critical jobs or databases
  * up to 90% discount from on-demand
* Dedicated Instances
  * no other customers share hardware
  * may share hardware with other instances in your account
* Dedicated Hosts
  * three years only
  * book entire physical server
  * full control of instance placement and hardware
  * useful for restrictive licenses or regulatory purposes

## Spot Instances

* define max spot price
  * have instance for as long as price is below max spot price
  * current spot price varies based on offer and capacity
  * 2 minute grace period to stop or terminate instance
* Spot Block - specify time frame
* Spot Request
  * define launch configuration, max price, desired number of instances
  * can choose persistent or one-time request
  * make sure to cancel persistent spot request before terminating spot instances
* Spot Fleet
  * set of spot instances + on-demand instances
  * tries to meet target capacity with given price constraints
  * setup launch pools (groups of instance types, OS, AZs)
  * strategies to allocate instances
    * lowestPrice - pick pool with lowest price
    * diversified - distribute instances across all pools
    * capacityOptimized - pick pool with optimal capacity for number of instances, reduces interruptions

## AMIs

* live in S3
* use to pre-install software, dependencies, etc.
* can share with another account
  * you own the AMI, but it can be copied and saved to another account
  * can't copy encrypted AMI, you have to copy and decrypt the underlying snapshot and re-encrypt it with your own key
* can't directly copy AMI with a billingProduct code or marketplace AMI

## Elastic IP

* fixed IP that can be allocated to an instance
* pay if not attached to server
* lets you quickly remap address to mask instance failure
* soft limit of five per account
* just use a load balancer or Route 53 alias

## CloudWatch

* AWS pushes some metrics automatically every five minutes
  * CPU, Network, Disk, Status Check metrics
    * CPU - Utilization, Burst Credit Usage
    * Network - Network I/O
    * Status Check - Instance and system status
    * Disk (instance store-backed only) - Disk I/O
    * NO RAM MONITORING by default
  * Can pay extra for detailed monitoring (every one minute)
* Custom metric lets you push your own metrics
  * Basic resolution (one minute)
  * High resolution (as low as one second)
  * Use for RAM or application specific metrics
  * Needs IAM CloudWatch instance role
  * Must install CloudWatch Unified Agent and provide config file (either locally or from SSM Parameter Store )
